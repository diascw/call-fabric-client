# Call Fabric Client

Call Fabric Client is a web application built with Next.js that streamlines video call management using the SignalWire API. It provides an intuitive interface for creating video rooms, managing contacts, authenticating users, and integrating seamlessly with SignalWire's video conferencing services.

The application leverages modern technologies such as React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand to ensure a smooth and efficient user experience.

## üìå Features

- **Video Conferencing:** Create and join video rooms with customizable settings.
- **Contact Directory:** Manage contacts with options to add, remove, and initiate calls.
- **User Authentication:** Sign up and log in with email and password, with local storage persistence.
- **Call Management:** Connect and disconnect calls in real-time with status updates.
- **Responsive Interface:** Optimized for various devices using Tailwind CSS.
- **State Management:** Utilizes React Context and Zustand for centralized state control.
- **Call History:** View a log of previous calls.

## üîß Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm or Yarn
- A SignalWire account with API credentials (Project ID, API Token, Space URL)

## üöÄ Installation

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/call-fabric-client.git
cd call-fabric-client
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project's root directory and populate it with your SignalWire credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN=<your-api-token>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPACE_URL=<your-space-url>
```

These credentials are required for API authentication and video room creation.

### Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## üìå Key Dependencies

| Dependency  | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| **Next.js** | A framework for React applications. |
| **React** | A library for building user interfaces. |
| **Zustand** | A lightweight state management library. |
| **React Context** | Built-in state management for global state control. |
| **Tailwind CSS** | A utility-first styling framework. |

## üõ†Ô∏è React Context Usage

React Context is used for managing global application state, providing a seamless way to pass data between components without prop drilling. In this project, it is used to handle user authentication and application state management efficiently.

```
import { createContext, useContext, useState, ReactNode } from "react";

interface AuthContextType {
  user: string | null;
  login: (user: string) => void;
  logout: () => void;
}

const AuthContext = createContext<AuthContextType | undefined>(undefined);

export const AuthProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const login = (username: string) => setUser(username);
  const logout = () => setUser(null);

  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, login, logout }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useAuth = () => {
  const context = useContext(AuthContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error("useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider");
  }
  return context;
};

```

For a complete list of dependencies, refer to `package.json`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Known Issues

- **Data Persistence:** Local storage is used for authentication and contacts. Future updates may integrate a database for better data management.
- **Token Management:** SignalWire tokens are not currently validated on the backend, which could allow unauthenticated calls.
- **SDK Issues:** The `@signalwire-community/react` package was chosen due to compatibility issues with `@signalwire/js`.
